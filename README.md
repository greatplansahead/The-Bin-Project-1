# The-Bin-Project-1

Welcome to my first project for the bin!
In this repo, you will follow me on my journey to creating my first circuit.
I intended to solve the problem of leaving the light on in my house. This is an issue that causes a huge waste of energy and money. in order to solve it, I created something that measures the light levels in a room during certain times in the day(to help remind me to turn off the lights when leaving the house!) and sounds a buzzer that olny stops when the light goes off. My project also doubles as an alarm than turns off when you pick up the structure.

Materials used:
- accelerometer
- raspberry pi pico
- led
- resistor
- photoresistor
- rtc
- oled
- buzzer

I had alot of fun in this project. It was definitly challenging because I had to learn everythin on my own and my idea wasn't the easiest. However, I loved solving the numerous problems that I encountered.

Here's a link to the project: https://wokwi.com/projects/406952707918652417

My alarm is set for 6:30 am and the photoresistor only detects light between the hours of 6 and 8.

I suggest you stay tuned for The Bin Project 2!
